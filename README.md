# Wildlife and Habitat Monitoring

This project leverages **big data and machine learning** to analyze species distribution and assess habitat suitability, contributing to **Sustainable Development Goal 15 (SDG 15: Life on Land)**. Using **Apache Spark and PySpark MLlib**, the project processes large-scale biodiversity data from the **Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF)**. **K-means clustering** is applied to group species based on geographic proximity, while a **Decision Tree model** predicts habitat suitability. The results are visualized using **Tableau**, providing actionable insights for conservation efforts.

## Features
‚úÖ **Big Data Processing**: Utilizes Apache Spark to handle large biodiversity datasets efficiently.  
‚úÖ **Species Clustering**: Uses K-means clustering to identify biodiversity hotspots.  
‚úÖ **Habitat Suitability Prediction**: Implements a Decision Tree classifier to assess suitable habitats for species.  
‚úÖ **Data Visualization**: Employs Tableau to create interactive maps and graphs for conservation analysis.

## Setup and Execution

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Install Dependencies
Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed:
```bash
pip install pyspark
```

---

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Preprocessing
Run the preprocessing script to prepare the dataset:
```bash
python wildlife_monitoring.py
```

---

###3Ô∏è‚É£ Run K-Means Clustering
Choose the appropriate clustering method:

Grouped Clusters:
```bash
python kmeans.py
```

Individual Species Clustering:
```bash
python kmeans_specieswise.py
```

---

###4Ô∏è‚É£ Run Decision Tree Model
Run the Decision Tree script for habitat suitability prediction:
```bash
python tree.py
```

---

###5Ô∏è‚É£ Visualization
Use Tableau for visualization:

First Visualization: üìå Plots all species on a map based on clusters. Filters can be applied by cluster number and species name.
Second Visualization: üìå Plots suitable habitat (coordinates) for each species based on maximum count.

###Notes
Ensure Tableau is installed to visualize the processed data.
Use the generated CSV files to create maps for better insights into species distribution and conservation strategies.
